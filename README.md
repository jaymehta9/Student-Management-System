Welcome to Student Management System — a complete academic management application built to simplify the handling of student, teacher, and course data.

This project includes full role-based access, dashboards, assignment tracking, grading, and course management. Inspired by real academic workflows, the project aims to provide an intuitive and organized interface for all user types.

The system is fully functional, scalable, and built using industry-level technologies like Spring Boot, Hibernate, and MySQL.

There is still more to build, but the system already covers all important operations smoothly.
